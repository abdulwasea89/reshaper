# VercelDeployer

The `VercelDeployer`class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Vercel. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](/reference/deployer/)class with Vercel specific functionality. 

## InstallationDirect link to Installation

```
npm install @mastra/deployer-vercel@latest
```

## Usage exampleDirect link to Usage example

src/mastra/index.ts 
```
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";import { VercelDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-vercel";export const mastra = new Mastra({  // ...  deployer: new VercelDeployer(),});
```

> See the VercelDeployer API reference for all available configuration options.

### Optional overridesDirect link to Optional overrides

The Vercel deployer can write a few high‑value settings into the Vercel Output API function config ( `.vc-config.json`): 

- maxDuration?: number — Function execution timeout (seconds)
- memory?: number — Function memory allocation (MB)
- regions?: string[] — Regions (e.g. ['sfo1','iad1'])

Example: 

src/mastra/index.ts 
```
deployer: new VercelDeployer({  maxDuration: 600,  memory: 1536,  regions: ["sfo1", "iad1"],});
```

## Continuous integrationDirect link to Continuous integration

After connecting your Mastra project’s Git repository to Vercel, update the project settings. In the Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings**> **Build and Deployment**, and under **Framework settings**, set the following: 

- Build command: npm run build (optional)

### Environment variablesDirect link to Environment variables

Before your first deployment, make sure to add any environment variables used by your application. For example, if you're using OpenAI as the LLM, you'll need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY`in your Vercel project settings. 

> See Environment variables for more details.

Your project is now configured with automatic deployments which occur whenever you push to the configured branch of your GitHub repository. 

## Manual deploymentDirect link to Manual deployment

Manual deployments are also possible using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). With the Vercel CLI installed run the following from your project root to deploy your application. 

```
npm run build && vercel --prod --prebuilt --archive=tgz
```

> You can also run vercel dev from your project root to test your Mastra application locally.

## Build outputDirect link to Build output

The build output for Mastra applications using the `VercelDeployer`includes all agents, tools, and workflows in your project, along with Mastra specific files required to run your application on Vercel. 

```
.vercel/├── output/│   ├── functions/│   │   └── index.func/│   │       └── index.mjs│   └── config.json└── package.json
```

The `VercelDeployer`automatically generates a `config.json`configuration file in `.vercel/output`with the following settings: 

```
{  "version": 3,  "routes": [    {      "src": "/(.*)",      "dest": "/"    }  ]}
```
